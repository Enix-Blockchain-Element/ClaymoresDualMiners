Claymore miner

You can download the latest version of Claymore miner here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1433925.0

Or download from this Git.

Once downloaded, extract the folder to a suitable location on your computer. (Such as a mining folder or onto the desktop.)

Be sure to check back frequently to get the latest version of the miner, as updates often increase your hash rate, as the miner becomes better optimised.
